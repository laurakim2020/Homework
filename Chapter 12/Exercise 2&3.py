#How many functions are in math module? 47 (according to Leo in section F)

import math
myvar = math.floor(78.89)
print(myvar)
myvar = math.ceil(78.89)
print(myvar)
#What does math.ceil do? What about math.floor? math.floor rounds down. math.ceil rounds up

#Describe how we have been computing the same value as math.sqrt without using the math module.
mysq = 16 ** (1/9)
print(mysq)
mysq = mathsqrt(16)
print(mysq)

#What are the two data constants in the math module? 'e' & 'pi'

#What does deepcopy do? In which exercises from last chapter would deepcopy have come in handy? Deepcopy returns a deep copy of x. It would come in handy for exercises that you didn't have to solve dealing with object reference since there is no answer.
